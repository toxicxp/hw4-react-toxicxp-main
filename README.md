# React

HW4: Basic React has been released. Instructions are below, due dates are listed on Gradescope. This will be a living document as we fix typos and clarify instructions. We will have a change log at the top for anything that changes.

## Instructions

The goal of this assignment is to setup your own React project and build a website similar to what was built in HW3, but different in some fundamental ways.

The React documentation will be very helpful to successfully completing this assignment For example, if you want to know how to create a button, you can google “Create a button in React.js”.

You can use the Github Classroom link to grab the start code. This is very basic code that is mostly just a blank React project.

For creating links to different pages, this is a good resource: [https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link)

You will be required to push your code to Github for submission.

Getting Started:

- Make sure have Node installed
- Clone the repo after you join the assignment.
- Navigate to the folder and run npm install inside the folder, at the same level with the file package.json etc.
- To see what the website looks like right now(it’s only one page) you can run npm run dev inside the cloned directory, this will start the website. You cannot just open the file in your browser as before because React needs to run and compile your code to something your browser understands.

Tasks:

You are not required to exactly match the styling of the example images for these tasks. You can use whatever styling you want. You are required to apply __some__ styling to the website but it can be whatever you want(background colors, etc).

1. Implement the home page from the sample screenshots. Note that while it looks similar to HW1, the user input will be phone numbers. We are also expecting simple validation of the phone numbers. Do not copy and paste the code from HW1…you will break things!
1. You should create separate files for the different components you write. You can store them wherever you want but ideally in src/components
1. Implement the about page as per the example screenshots. Make sure to update the contents of the page to reflect something personal to you (don’t leave a picture of a cat and the generic text)
1. Link the two pages together so that you can navigate between them
1. Apply some styles to some/all of the website. Choose what you want — you don’t need to match the example exactly. You just need to apply some styling.
1. Your code must pass eslint.
